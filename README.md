# **RECRUITMENT ANALYTICS (USING SQL AND POWER BI)**

This project aims to provide actionable insights into recruitment data by identifying key trends and bottlenecks in the hiring process. 
By focusing on metrics such as time-to-hire, candidate sources, and the efficiency of interview stages, it seeks to enhance overall recruitment workflows. 
Leveraging data-driven analysis, the project will help optimize sourcing strategies, recommend process improvements, and ultimately lead to faster hiring decisions, improved efficiency, and reduced recruitment costs.
